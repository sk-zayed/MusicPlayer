# MusicPlayer

Hey,

This is my first android-java project.

This android application scans all the directories and lists all the .mp3 files stored in user's mobile phone.

Once all the files are listed user can play any audio file by clicking on it.

While the song is playing user can play the next or previous song by clicking on the respective buttons. Also, user can track the current progress of a song with the help of SeekBar.

(PS: It takes a bit of time to scan the directory. So please be patient.)
